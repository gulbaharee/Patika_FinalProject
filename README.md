# Patika_FinalProject

## Description

This is the final project for Akbank react native bootcamp. In this project, except react-native packages I used a few additional packages. You can install using the necessary commands in the Installation section.


The main purpose of the project was to chat. App e registered users are listed on the contact page. When you click on people, you will be directed to the chat page. sent messages are kept in firestore, but since the grouping structure is not fully formed, you will see a separate chat page for each message. this will be developed. You can update user information, add profile photo and change theme on profile page.
